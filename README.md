# AnalChem
Python notebooks for teaching undergraduate analytical chemistry.

We used these notebooks in conjunction with the Harris textbook for the junior level Analytical Chemistry course. The students did everything on the cloud. There are several cloud servers that can be used, including ones from Microsoft (https://notebooks.azure.com/) and Google (https://colab.research.google.com/). 

I've posted here all the data and the notebooks that were given to the students. They were instructed to complete the problems, print it out as a PDF, and upload that into our course management software. Overall, it was a very smooth way to teach programming, and there were almost no technical issues with running the software in the cloud. 

Let me know if you have any questions. I am happy to send out the answer keys to instructors (mtmarty@arizona.edu). Thanks!
