# Python notebooks for teaching undergraduate Analytical Chemistry

We used these notebooks in conjunction with the Harris textbook for the junior level Analytical Chemistry course at the University of Arizona. The students did this with either cloud servers, remote desktop, and installing it on their personal computers. There are several cloud servers that can be used, including Google (https://colab.research.google.com/). At the University of Arizona, students can use the vCat remote desktop server: https://arizona.apporto.com/. 

I've posted here all the data and the notebooks that were given to the students. They were instructed to complete the problems, print it out as a PDF, and upload that into our course management software. Overall, it was a very smooth way to teach programming.

I have also included notebooks used for the Analytical Chemistry Lab (CHEM326) and the graduate analytical chemsitry lab (CHEM528) for any who are interested.

Let me know if you have any questions. I am happy to send out the answer keys to instructors (mtmarty@arizona.edu). Thanks!
